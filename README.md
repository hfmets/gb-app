# GbApp

This is a personal project I built while learning Angular and Typescript. It utilizes the GiantBomb API to access their wide backlog of videos for any users with a login. Once a user validates their GB account, they can use the site to browse the videos. I also used PrimeNG for several of their Angular components like a paginated DataView and MenuBar. There are still some things I would like to add like visible differences between premium and non premium videos, sorting, and searching.

The site can be visited here:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.
